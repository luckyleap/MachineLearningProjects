# MachineLearning Projects
Short scripts of projects that I am currently working on in the graduate machine learning class

## Project 1
1. Classification Pipeline
	* Train multiclass models to distinguish between flowersets of the [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)

2. Segmentation via Clustering
	* K-means algorithm implementation on [Berkeley Segmentation Dataset](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/)


3. Linear Regression
	* Linear regression using least-squares error on [Wine Quality Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

## Project 3 
1. Simple Neural Network
	* Implement a simple neural network with only a single hidden layer
	*
