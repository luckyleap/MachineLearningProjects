Problem 1:
Use machine learning to classify different faces for identification of a person

Features:
Histogram of gradients for the frontal face, edge features of a the person's eyes, line features of a person

Labels:
Target label - A person's id, given the person's face

Collect Data:
To collect the data, I can take pictures of 100 volunteers' faces. Then, I can run the face images for feature extraction on the edges, and HoGs.

Challenges:
The person's facial image might have different lighting that distorts the features. If the person wears glasses and has no glasses in the test, the person might be incorrectly labelled.




Problem 2:
Use machine learning to predict the right ratio of ingredients for a smoothie restaurant for customers

Features:
Customers rate each smoothie from a 1-10 preference scale, with 10 being the best.
The type of ingredient in a smoothie
The amount of ingredients in a smoothie
The time of the day
The type of customers

Labels:
Target label - The rating of the smoothie

Collect Data:
To collect data, I can survey each customer after the customer has tasted the smoothie, recording the time, the customer data, and rating of the smoothie.

Challenges:
There is a limited number of smoothies of each kind of ingredient. This will create a small amount of data for each type of label.



Problem 3:
Use machine learning to play Super Mario

Features:
Position of mario
Position of enemies
Mario's current 'action'
Time
Mario's possible 'next action'

Labels:
Target Label- Mario's next move

Collect Data:
Run Mario through several thousand trials, updating the best possible next movie with each trial

Challenges:
Mario has to get the next move at a fast enough pace otherwise the state of the game will be in a different state for the 'next move'
