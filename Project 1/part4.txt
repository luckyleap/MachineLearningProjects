1. Least Squares Solution L2 Error:  19.0883688833
2. Gradient Descent Solution L2 Error:  20.54346988

Observations:
As the learning rate increases, the convergence happens faster. However, it becomes really easy to have the error go shoot up to infinity when the learning rate is too high (> 0.01)

If the learning rate is small, the convergence takes very long.
